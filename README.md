# Benchmark: Lua Binding

A benchmarking many of the canonical/best/popular lua bindings for their performance.

# Current Bindings

The following bindings are benchmarked or are being aimed to be benchmarked:

[ ] - luawrapper
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 
[ ] - 

If you feel there is a binding that needs to be benchmarked, please either make a pull request for that library or make an issue request. Please note that I am not particularly thrilled to benchmark libraries that cannot compile on Visual C++'s latest compiler and have had quite my fill of hacking older, unmaintained libraries to make them compile for recent compilers. If the library you suggest has no documentation and fills my terminal with errors I am likely going to throw it out the window.

I want _working_, _halfway decent_ libraries, not more things I need to make personal forks of in order for them to compile properly only to muck around in an undocumented mess.
